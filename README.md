# ASCBootcampSP2020
This a project I built for the bootcamp which introduces students of Agnes Scott to Web development during the Spring of 2020 Bootcamp. Technologies used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

There are multiple files created which start with an introduction to a great website. At the end, people should incorporate APIs to help their website become more functional.

The home page will render the index.html page, but if one wants to see how to render other pages as one works through this tutorial, here are the pages:
Home page is: https://ekayiigirwa.github.io/ASCBootcampSP2020/
For other pages, add the filename to that path in a format: https://ekayiigirwa.github.io/ASCBootcampSP2020/Filename

Eg: https://ekayiigirwa.github.io/ASCBootcampSP2020/withSomeLogic-slide7.html


Git Commands:

- git clone “url to repository”
- git status: to check the status of your repository
* Copy your files to the repo : cp [path to the file you want to copy] [path to the destination directory]
eg: cp ~/website/index.html  ~/aboutMe(which is your repository on your computer)
- Check the status: git status again
- Add all files: git add -A
- To Commit: git commit -m  “write a message to explain”
- To push your changes to Github: git push origin master
- To make sure that your master is actually up to date: Run “git pull”

To make sure that your master on github is in-sync with master on your local computer, run this command:
* git reset --soft HEAD~1
- Then, pull 
- Solve conflicts
- Commit as per usual by running: git commit
- Then, push: git push origin master
