# ASCBootcampSP2020
This a project I built for the bootcamp which introduces students of Agnes Scott to Web development during the Spring of 2020 Bootcamp. Technologies used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

There are multiple files created which start with an introduction to a great website. At the end, people should incorporate APIs to help their website become more functional.
